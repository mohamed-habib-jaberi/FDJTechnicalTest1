# Project Overview and Design Choices

## Introduction

This project implements a solution using SwiftUI and Combine for a sports league application. The architecture follows the principles of Clean Architecture, which divides the application into distinct layers: Presentation, Domain, and Data.

## Architecture Layers

### 1. Presentation Layer (MVVM)

SwiftUI is used for the presentation layer, following the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern. Views are responsible for rendering the UI, ViewModels handle the presentation logic and state management, and Models represent the data.

### 2. Domain Layer

This layer contains business logic and use cases. Interactors (or Use Cases) are responsible for coordinating the flow of data within the app. They interact with the Repository interfaces to perform actions like fetching data or performing business logic operations.

### 3. Data Layer

This layer handles data access and network communication. It consists of Repository implementations and Network Services. The Repository pattern is used to abstract data access and provide a clear separation between data sources and the rest of the application.

## Design Patterns

### Repository Pattern

The Repository pattern is used to decouple data access logic from the rest of the application. Repository interfaces define methods for data operations (e.g., fetching leagues or teams), which are then implemented by concrete Repository classes. This pattern allows for easier testing and swapping out data sources without affecting other parts of the app.

## Implementation Details

- **Interactor-Repository Interaction:** Interactors communicate with repositories to perform data operations. Repositories abstract away the details of data access, such as fetching data from a remote API or a local database. This separation ensures that business logic remains isolated from data access concerns.

- **Data Mapping (Data Mapper):** Repositories use Data Mappers to map data transfer objects (DTOs) received from data sources to domain models expected by interactors. This mapping ensures that the domain layer operates with domain-specific models, decoupled from any data source-specific details.

- **Asynchronous Data Loading:** Asynchronous programming techniques, such as async/await and Combine, are utilized for handling network requests and asynchronous data loading. This ensures that the UI remains responsive while data is being fetched from remote sources.

## Conclusion

By following the principles of Clean Architecture and leveraging SwiftUI and Combine, the project achieves a clean separation of concerns, making the codebase modular, maintainable, and testable. The use of design patterns like the Repository pattern and asynchronous programming techniques enhances the scalability and performance of the application.
